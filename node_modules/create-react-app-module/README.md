# create-react-app-module

Starter kit for development of react modules/components

`npm install create-react-app-module`

`create-react-app-module create|update <comp-name>`

#### Roadmap
* [x] Elint
* [x] Babel
* [x] Webpack
* [x] Hot Module loader
* [ ] Jasmine Unit test
* [ ] Visual tests
* [ ] Functional tests
* [ ] Code coverage
* [ ] Build config
* [ ] Publish config

#### Create components with zero build configurations
Aim of the project is to build reusable __BUILD CONFIG__.

With this one should be able to:
* Start creating new component with the build configuration
* Update component's build configuration with no efforts

This will help achieve __independent component development__ .

#### To contribute, here are upcoming tasks in the app.

* npm install the module globally and run component-builder update [comp-name] to update existing component created by component builder
* add jasmine for unit testing
* galen for visual/functional tests [optional]
